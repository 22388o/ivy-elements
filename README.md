# Ionio

Ionio is a higher-level language that allows you to write smart contracts for the Elements blockchain. It can compile to instructions for Elementsâ€™s virtual machine, a superset of Bitcoin Script.

Its syntax is based on Bitcoin's smart contract language [Ivy](https://ivylang.org/bitcoin) developed at [Chain](https://chain.com), but its functionality is enhanced since smart contracts for Elements differ greatly from smart contracts on Bitcoin.

You can try out Ionio using the [Ionio Playground for Elements Tapscript](https://ionio-lang.org/playground), which allows you to create test contracts and try spending them, all in a sandboxed environment.

You can learn more about Ionio and using the Ionio Playground for Bitcoin by reading the [docs](https://ionio-lang.org/docs).

**Ionio is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to use Ionio to control real Bitcoins.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome; you can create an [issue](https://github.com/ionio-lang/ionio/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/ionio-lang/ionio/pulls) on this repo.
