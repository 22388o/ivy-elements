# Ionio Language

Ionio is a higher-level language that allows you to write smart contracts for the Elements blockchain. It can compile to instructions for Elementsâ€™s execution enviroment, which targets Elements Tapscript or Simplicity.

It's syntax is based on Bitcoin's smart contract language [Ivy](https://ivylang.org/bitcoin), but its functionality is enhanced since smart contracts for Elements differ greatly from smart contracts on Bitcoin.


**Ionio is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to use Ionio to control real Bitcoins.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome; you can create an [issue](https://github.com/ionio-lang/ionio/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/ionio-lang/ionio/pulls) on this repo.
